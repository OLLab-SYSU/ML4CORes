- **Large Language Models**：Most research utilizes existing FMs from language and vision domains to generate/improve solutions* or algorithms* (hyper-heuristic), yielding impressive results when integrated with problem-specific heuristics or general meta-heuristics. Other studies employ LLMs to investigate the interpretability* of COP solvers, automate problem formulation*, or simplify the use of domain-specific tools through text prompts. Given the capabilities of LLMs, this area of research is likely to garner increasing interest.

- **Domain Foundation Models**: Developing a domain FM capable of solving a wide range of COPs presents an intriguing and formidable challenge. Recent efforts in this area aim towards this ambitious goal by creating a unified architecture or representation applicable across various COPs.
